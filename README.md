# National Collaboration on Bike, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data

## Objective
The National Collaboration on Bike, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data (NC-BPAID) is working across sectors to develop shared data specifications for geospatial bicycle, pedestrian and accessibility infrastructure data across the United States, to enable data sharing and coordination at a national scale. If you are developing, standardizing or using these kinds of data, [join the collaboration](#contribute) and help to shape the specifications. 

## Get Involved
Your participation in this collaboration is welcome. Anyone can join, whether you’re with a government agency, university, for-profit, nonprofit or a private citizen. Here are some ways to get involved:
1.	Join our mailing list to receive invitations to upcoming collaboration meetings and major announcements. 
2.	Attend an upcoming meeting of the collaboration (listed below).
3.	Contribute your knowledge by [joining a subgroup](#working-group) (meeting times listed below).
4.	Engage with us here on Github by posting a GitHub [Issue](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/issues) or [Discussion](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/discussions), or making suggested changes using a  [Pull Request](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/pulls). Learn about using GitHub as a [tool for collaboration and support](#contribute).

## Background
Nationwide, there is a data gap for people walking, biking, and rolling: the location and attributes of the infrastructure that allows for safe and comfortable travel – like sidewalks, bike lanes, and curb ramps – is often unmapped or unknown. Data may exist for this infrastructure, but it can be fragmented across geography, unstandardized in structure and content, and vary in its openness to the public. 

The objective of the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/)' is to help fill that data gap with nationwide geospatial data layers for the extent, connectivity, and condition of bicycle, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure in public rights of way and transportation terminals.

There are many organizations who have recognized and are working towards filling this data gap across government, academic, nonprofit, or private sectors. Coordinating this work - the intent of this community - will progress the field towards widespread, interoperable geospatial data. Standardization and synthetization of the data across jurisdictions is the first step to making the data available, easy to access and easy to use.

There are many organizations who have recognized and are working towards filling this data gap across the government, academic, nonprofit, and private sectors. NC-BPAID is coordinating this work to help the field progress towards widespread, interoperable geospatial data.
