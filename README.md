# General Active Transportation Infrastructure Specification (GATIS)
Voting is currently open to advance the first formal version of the General Active Transportation Infrastructure Specification (GATIS)! If your organization is a member of NC-BPAID, you can [VOTE HERE](https://forms.office.com/g/NcLfAe2R86). **Voting will be open until February 27th, 11:59 pm PT.**

Review the draft specification on the [GATIS Explorer](https://dotbts.github.io/BPA/). All of the materials under the “View Draft Specification” button on the Explorer are part of the vote. You can also review, edit and comment on the [GATIS Playbook draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z_iwS-F72bcdDIspbXcNryHii1Yu2p9P7p8rmdS9fs8/edit?tab=t.0). The Playbook is not a part of the vote and will go to its own vote in the spring after the draft is finalized. 

Previous drafts of the specification are available for viewing at these links:
- Draft #3: [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pzMQbQcTJ6QNTx53aFimS_9Dko8c3HPh/edit) and [Google Sheet of features and attributes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j-CuaOruFdZDBNaKEW1J3-mdMLdl3pY_K_xRJRcMo8I/edit?gid=99439912#gid=99439912) (This draft mostly matches the version of the specification currently being voted on)
- Draft #2: [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cNpTRCuOB3vxFeGjYrlMsXo855OtfCvipv57dcBcu9w/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0) and [Google Sheet of features and attributes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qs0x58V-Gcikm70AKxsXxKH7D4TL6z8FlBgf4P4kqJQ/edit?gid=2090301280#gid=2090301280)

## Draft Specification Files
The [draft_gatis_specification/specification_jsons](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/tree/main/draft_gatis_specification/specification_jsons) folder contains JSON files that describe the different types and allowed attributes for each GATIS feature type. The [draft_gatis_specification/templates](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/tree/main/draft_gatis_specification/templates) folder contains GeoJSON files that reflect the recommended and required types and attributes for each feature type at each tier level plus one that includes all optional attributes. Lastly, the [draft_gatis_specification/sample_data](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/tree/main/draft_gatis_specification/sample_data) contains Jupyter Notebooks showing example pipelines for converting existing municipal data into GATIS. The notebook also contains links to download the sample data.

## Providing Feedback on the Draft Specification
The Google Document and Google Sheet linked above allow for comments and suggested edits. You do not need to be signed into a Google account to comment. If you are signed into a Google account, your name will be attached to the comment and you will receive notifications if your comment has been responded to. If you are not signed into a Google account, consider adding your name to the comment (optional). Note that you will not receive a notification if your comment has been responded to, so you may need to check in the document periodically. 

If you’d like a response, please say so and we’ll do our best to respond directly. Whether or not we respond, your feedback will be taken into account for the next draft. If you have a lot of thoughts or ideas to share, please consider [joining an upcoming meeting of the Specifications Development Subgroup](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/?tab=readme-ov-file#upcoming-meetings) or [filling out our contact form](https://forms.office.com/g/c6gsQbB2VH). 

When commenting on the draft, please keep our Collaboration Framework in mind, specifically the section that refers to [Building an Effective Collaboration](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/blob/main/documents/drafts/CollaborationFramework.md#building-an-effective-collaboration).

# The National Collaboration on Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data (NC-BPAID)
The National Collaboration on Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data (NC-BPAID) is working across sectors to develop shared data specifications for geospatial bicycle, pedestrian and accessibility infrastructure data across the United States, to enable data sharing and coordination at a national scale. If you are developing, standardizing or using these kinds of data, [join the collaboration](https://forms.office.com/g/34975BEAkF) and help to shape the specifications.

## Get Involved
Your participation in this collaboration is welcome. Anyone can join, whether you’re with a government agency, university, for-profit, nonprofit or a private citizen. Here are some ways to get involved:
1.	Join our [mailing list](https://forms.office.com/g/34975BEAkF) to receive invitations to upcoming collaboration meetings and major announcements. 
2.	Attend an upcoming meeting of the collaboration (listed below).
3.	Contribute your knowledge by [joining a subgroup](https://forms.office.com/g/fnccNdugBN). (meeting times listed below).

To contact us or ask a question, please fill out [this form](https://forms.office.com/g/c6gsQbB2VH). 

## Upcoming Meetings
We typically meet every other month. All meetings are held on Microsoft Teams. Please [join the list](https://forms.office.com/g/34975BEAkF) to have the invites sent to you. The next collaboration meetings will be held:  
- [Thursday, October 30, 2025 @ 3:00pm ET](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/wiki/2025-10-30)
- Thursday, December 4, 2025 @ 3:00pm ET

We also have three subgroups that meet regularly and have opportunities to work asynchronously, too. To get connected with these groups, please fill out [this form](https://forms.office.com/g/fnccNdugBN):
- Subgroup on Data Practices: Working to facilitate the adoption of specifications and practices. Meets every first Thursday @ 3:00pm ET.
- Subgroup on Outreach: Working to ensure the specifications are increasingly adopted/recognized by data producers and consumers. Meets every first Thursday @ 4:00pm ET.
- Subgroup on Specification Development: Working on drafting the specifications and guiding them through review. Meets every other Wednesday @ 4:00pm ET.

You can find information about all previous meetings, including agendas and slides, on the [wiki](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/wiki).

## Background
Nationwide, there is a data gap for people walking, biking, and rolling. The location and attributes of the infrastructure that allows for safe and comfortable travel -- like sidewalks, bike lanes, and curb ramps -- is often unmapped or unknown. Data may exist for this infrastructure, but it can be fragmented across geography, unstandardized in structure and content, and vary in its openness to the public. 

The objective of the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/) is to help fill that data gap with nationwide geospatial data layers for the extent, connectivity, and condition of bicycle, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure in public rights of way and transportation terminals. Standardization and synthetization of the data across jurisdictions is the first step to making the data available, easy to access and easy to use.

There are many organizations who have recognized and are working towards filling this data gap across the government, academic, nonprofit, and private sectors. NC-BPAID is coordinating this work to help the field progress towards widespread, interoperable geospatial data.
