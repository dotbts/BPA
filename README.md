# National Collaboration on Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data

## Objective
The National Collaboration on Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data (NC-BPAID) is working across sectors to develop shared data specifications for geospatial bicycle, pedestrian and accessibility infrastructure data across the United States, to enable data sharing and coordination at a national scale. If you are developing, standardizing or using these kinds of data, [join the collaboration](https://forms.office.com/g/34975BEAkF) and help to shape the specifications.

## See the Draft Specification
Draft one of the General Active Transportation Infrastructure Specification (GATIS) (name is tentative) is now available for public review and comment. This draft was developed by the Specification Development Subgroup.  

There are two ways to access the draft, a PDF copy and a Google Document, which allows for comments.

You do not need to be signed into a Google account to comment. If you are signed into a Google account, your name will be attached to the comment and you will receive notifications if your comment has been responded to. If you are not signed into a Google account, consider adding your name to the comment (optional). Note that you will not receive a notification if your comment has been responded to, so you may need to check in the document periodically. 

If you’d like a response, please say so and we’ll do our best to respond directly. Whether or not we respond, your feedback will be taken into account for the next draft. If you have a lot of thoughts or ideas to share, please consider [joining an upcoming meeting of the Specifications Development Subgroup](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/?tab=readme-ov-file#upcoming-meetings) or [filling out our contact form](https://forms.office.com/g/c6gsQbB2VH). 

When commenting on the draft, please keep our Collaboration Framework in mind, specifically the section that refers to [Building an Effective Collaboration](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/blob/main/documents/drafts/CollaborationFramework.md#building-an-effective-collaboration).

## Background
Nationwide, there is a data gap for people walking, biking, and rolling. The location and attributes of the infrastructure that allows for safe and comfortable travel -- like sidewalks, bike lanes, and curb ramps -- is often unmapped or unknown. Data may exist for this infrastructure, but it can be fragmented across geography, unstandardized in structure and content, and vary in its openness to the public. 

The objective of the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/) is to help fill that data gap with nationwide geospatial data layers for the extent, connectivity, and condition of bicycle, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure in public rights of way and transportation terminals. Standardization and synthetization of the data across jurisdictions is the first step to making the data available, easy to access and easy to use.

There are many organizations who have recognized and are working towards filling this data gap across the government, academic, nonprofit, and private sectors. NC-BPAID is coordinating this work to help the field progress towards widespread, interoperable geospatial data.
