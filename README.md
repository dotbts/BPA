# Geospatial Bike, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data

## Background
Nationwide, there is a data gap for people walking, biking, and rolling: the location and attributes of the infrastructure that allows for safe and comfortable travel – like sidewalks, bike lanes, and curb ramps – is often unknown. Data may exist for this infrastructure, but it can be fragmented across geography, unstandardized in structure and content, and vary in its openness to the public. 

The [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/)' objective is to fill that data gap with nationwide geospatial data layers for the extent, connectivity, and condition of bicycle, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure in public rights of way and transportation terminals.

There are many organizations who have recognized and are working towards filling this data gap across government, academic, nonprofit, or private sectors. Coordinating this work - the intent of this community - will progress the field towards widespread, interoperable geospatial data.

## Objective
The intent of this community is to communicate, coordinate, and align efforts to develop geospatial bicycle, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure data across the United States. If you are working to develop, standardize, or use these kinds of data, participating in this community will give you the information you need to maximize your contribution.
