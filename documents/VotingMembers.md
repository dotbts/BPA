# Voting Members
This is the list of NC-BPAID [voting members](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/blob/main/documents/drafts/CollaborationFramework.md#voting-members). 
If you vote and nobody from your organization has previously voted, then you are the default voting member for your organization and the BTS team will add your information to this list.
If you vote and someone from your organization is already a designated voting member, the BTS team will contact you to identify the correct voting member.
If you would like to add (or remove) your information to this list outside the context of a vote, open a pull request or contact the BTS team.
