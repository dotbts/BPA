# Voting Members
Here is the most recent list of NC-BPAID voting members:

**[Voting Members - March 31, 2025](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/blob/main/documents/main-documents/NC-BPAID_Voting_Members.csv)**


Please see the [Collaboration Framework](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA/blob/main/documents/drafts/CollaborationFramework.md#voting-members) to learn more about voting members and the voting process.

If you vote and nobody from your organization has previously voted, or if you are the only member of NC-BPAID from your organization, then you are the default voting member for your organization, and the BTS team will add your information to this list. 

This list may be missing some voting members or not be perfectly up to date for your organization. If information about an organization is unclear or confusing, it has been left off. **When in doubt, vote!** The BTS team will check who voted against this list and our records, and we will reach out with any questions.

If you would like to add (or remove) your information, contact the BTS team.
