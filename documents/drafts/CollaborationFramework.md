# Collaboration Framework
The __National Collaboration on Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data (NC-BPAID)__ is organized under the [Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)](https://www.fgdc.gov/) [Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee](https://www.fgdc.gov/organization/working-groups-subcommittees/tsc/index_html). The FGDC Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee provides leadership, direction, and administrative support in the use and development of geospatial information across national, tribal, subnational, academia, nonprofit, and private sector organizations. This document - the collaboration framework - details the structures and processes that the members of the collaboration agree to use in working together and serves as the group’s charter under FGDC. This document is always subject to modification by NC-BPAID members. If you would like to suggest a change to this document, create a pull request with the proposed change. 

The NC-BPAID is not an advisory body. It accomplishes work which could not be achieved separately by its individual participants. This collaboration is necessary because of the complexities surrounding the creation, collection, processing, publication, integration, visualization, analysis, and curation of bicycle, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure data from all levels of government, across all jurisdictions, and among government, private, nonprofit, and academic organizations. 

## PURPOSE 
The purpose of NC-BPAID is to advance a state of comprehensive, interoperable, and routable data on bike, pedestrian, and physical accessibility infrastructure that informs decision-making for individual travelers—as well as the government, private, nonprofit, and academic sectors—through the mechanism of open data standards.

## SCOPE
The scope of the NC-BPAID is limited to: 
* Developing or endorsing open standards and practices that support the objective collection, exchange, portability, and refutability of high-quality data.
* Facilitating adoption of these standards and practices by data producers and consumers.
* Promoting the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of bicycle, pedestrian, and physical accessibility infrastructure datasets.

NC-BPAID—as an entity—will not collect or publish data. 

Ultimately, the NC-BPAID should designate an independent and sustainable bicycle, pedestrian, and physical accessibility infrastructure data governance organization that will lead the work of maintaining and adapting the standards over time to reflect evolving real world conditions and soliciting representative involvement from the broad spectrum of stakeholders.

## MEMBERSHIP 
Membership in the NC-BPAID WILL BE open to national, tribal, subnational, academic, non-profit and for-profit organizations, as well as individuals. Members are expected to be active in the creation, collection, processing, publication, integration, visualization, analysis, or curation of bike, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure data within their organization or community. 

### Voting Members
The NC-BPAID is committed to collaborative decision-making. Some organizations MAY have multiple members who participate in NC-BPAID. To ensure fairness among organizations, each organization SHALL have only one vote, and therefore only one voting member. Each member organization SHALL designate their voting member and inform the NC-BPAID administrative team via email. Only voting members MAY vote, become a co-chair, or chair a subgroup. 

Voting members and their affiliations are listed in this repository. 

### Non-Voting Members
Any member of NC-BPAID who is not a voting member SHALL be a non-voting member. Non-voting members SHALL NOT vote, but they MAY provide input or influence the discussion and direction of NC-BPAID in other ways, including participating as subgroup members. 

### Co-Chairs
The NC-BPAID SHALL be led by three co-chairs elected from the membership. There SHALL NOT be more than one co-chair from a single organization. The co-chair term SHALL be one year. The responsibilities of a co-chair are expected to fill approximately five hours per month. The responsibilities of a co-chair SHALL BE: 
* Strategic leadership of NC-BPAID 
* Guide the formation of NC-BPAID's objectives and activities 
* Co-host meetings with the administrative team 
* Advise subgroups and approve subgroup plans and direction 

Ideally, co-chairs are leaders with direct or delegated decision-making authority who are familiar with their organization’s bike, pedestrian, or accessibility infrastructure data assets, needs, and challenges. They SHOULD have a deep level of technical acumen, commensurate with the level of specific data sets used by their organization. They SHALL ideally be in a position to drive adoption (e.g., establishing data feeds or standards) within their organization. 

## ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM
A set of Bureau of Transportation Statistics and other U.S. Department of Transportation staff (including federal employees, fellows, contractors and interns) SHALL assist in running the day-to-day activities of the NC-BPAID and be involved in some governance activities as outlined in this framework. This team SHALL help to administer and enforce the voting process. As with other organizations, the U.S. Department of Transportation SHALL have one voting member, and no action of the administrative team SHALL override the results of a vote taken by the membership.  

The administrative team SHALL collaborate with the co-chairs on some decisions as outlined in this framework. Where decisions are made collaboratively, the majority of co-chairs SHALL have equal weight with the majority of the administrative team. 

As of May 7, 2025, the members of the administrative team are:   
* Jay Davis, Bureau of Transportation Statistics 
* Justyna Goworowska, Bureau of Transportation Statistics
* Reid Passmore, Bureau of Transportation Statistics
* Sara Secunda, Volpe Center, USDOT
* Carl Fredlund, MobilityData

This document SHALL be updated with current administrative team members when changes occur. 

## DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURES
Most of the time, voting SHALL happen online and asynchronously, via a GitHub Discussion, through a web form or through email. Each online voting period SHALL be at least one week. Voting periods SHALL be opened and announced with an email communication to members, sent by a member of the administrative team. For any form of online voting, a quorum SHALL NOT be REQUIRED, because all voting members SHALL be informed via email of the vote and given at least one week to cast their vote. For any votes that MAY happen during a synchronous meeting, a quorum of at least 25% of voting members MUST be present. 

### Vote Type
| Type  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| +1  | "Yes," "Agree," or "the action should be performed." |
| -1  | “No,” “Disagree,” or “the action should not be performed.” On issues where "lazy approval” is used, this vote counts as a veto. All vetoes must contain an explanation of why the veto is appropriate. Vetoes with no explanation are void. It may also be appropriate for a -1 vote to include an alternative course of action. |
| Abstain  | Voting members can abstain from voting. They can either remain silent or express their reason. Abstentions do not count towards the total votes. |

### Approval Types
Three different types of votes SHALL be used by the NC-BPAID. For all three types of votes, only voting members MAY participate. 
| Vote Type  | Threshold | Purpose | Venue | Hypothetical Example | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Supermajority  | 75% majority of participating voters  | Decisions on final outputs or working group products. | Online / asynchronous _or_ synchronous (quorum REQUIRED)  | Specification approval; changes to specification. |
| Majority  | Simple majority (50% + 1) of participating voters | Decisions on board strategy or other high level questions, including co-chair election. | Online / asynchronous _or_ synchronous (quorum REQUIRED)  | Approval of purpose and scope; approval of goals / objectives; co-chair election. |
| "Lazy" Approval  | Implicit allowance unless a veto is received, at which time majority approval must be obtained. | Procedural or minor changes; oversight of chair or administrative team activities. | Online / asynchronous  | Change to documentation; review of co-chair plan to designate subgroups. |

Some decisions that come before the NC-BPAID might not obviously fit into one of these categories. Any questions about how to proceed with a vote SHALL be resolved by the co-chairs in consultation with the administrative team, including which type of vote SHALL be held and whether it SHALL be held online / asynchronously or synchronously.  

## ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES
1. The administrative team SHALL announce meetings, according to a schedule determined by the collaboration. Meetings MAY be virtual or in-person.
2. The administrative team SHALL coordinate agenda items, in consultation with the co-chairs, and make an agenda available at least two days in advance of a meeting.
3. Co-chairs SHALL be granted editing rights to the GitHub repository when elected.
4. Co-chairs MAY implement grammatical changes to any document the collaboration authors.
5. Co-chairs SHALL establish at least one subgroup, and MAY establish more, to accomplish the objectives and activities. Subgroup proposals SHALL be subject to “lazy” approval by voting members. By default, subgroups SHALL adopt this collaboration framework for their decision-making procedure.
6. Co-chairs SHALL oversee subgroup activities, and subgroup plans SHALL be subject to co-chair approval. ​
7. Members SHALL review and update this collaboration framework as needed, at least annually. The framework SHALL be adopted by majority vote. 

Members MAY refer unresolvable conflicts to the FGDC Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee Chair. Members MAY appeal the chair’s resolution to the Director of the Office of Spatial Analysis and Visualization, Bureau of Transportation Statistics.  

The NC-BPAID MAY employ the tools and mediums best suited to meet its responsibilities such as online webinars, teleconferences, national user forums, annual research initiatives, and cooperative venues, pursuant to the availability of resources. The co-chairs SHALL coordinate activities with other working groups and subcommittees, FGDC coordination groups, and other appropriate parties that are relevant to accomplishing key activities.

* __Long-Term Perspective:__ Take a long-term perspective on relationships and outcomes and prioritize sustainable and enduring solutions.
* __Adaptability and Learning:__ Be willing to adapt and learn, and recognize that your ideas may need to be refined or adjusted over time as circumstances change, new information emerges, or societal norms evolve.
* __Communication:__ Engage in clear and open communication that can help build trust and understanding among individuals and groups, fostering more constructive relationships.
* __Conflict Resolution:__ In situations where conflicts arise, try to resolve them using constructive and fair approaches, such as dialogue, mediation, or some other mutually agreeable solution.
* __Personal and Organizational Development:__ Prioritize ongoing personal and organizational development, including continuous learning and reflection.  
  
## REPORTS 
The NC-BPAID SHALL develop an annual summary of accomplishments and planned activities, presenting this summary to the GTS Chair for acceptance. The NC-BPAID, through its co-chairs, SHALL submit content for the FGDC Annual Report each year, as requested by the FGDC Secretariat. The GTS Chair MAY request the NC-BPAID to prepare special reports or briefings to address FGDC reporting requirements. The BPAID SHALL maintain information about its activities on the GitHub web site at [https://github.com/dotbts/BPA](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA). A reference to the GitHub site SHALL be established on [fgdc.gov](fgdc.gov).
