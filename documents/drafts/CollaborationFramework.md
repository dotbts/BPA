# Collaboration Framework
The __National Collaboration on Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data (NC-BPAID)__ is organized under the [Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)](https://www.fgdc.gov/) [Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee](https://www.fgdc.gov/organization/working-groups-subcommittees/tsc/index_html). The FGDC Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee provides leadership, direction, and administrative support in the use and development of geospatial information across national, tribal, subnational, academia, nonprofit, and private sector organizations. This document - the collaboration framework - details the structures and processes that the members of the collaboration agree to use in working together. This document is always subject to modification by NC-BPAID members. If you would like suggest a change to this document, create a pull request with the proposed change.

The NC-BPAID is not an advisory body. It accomplishes work which could not be achieved separately by its individual participants. This collaboration is necessary because of the complexities surrounding the creation, collection, processing, publication, integration, visualization, analysis, and curation of bicycle, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure data from all levels of government, across all jurisdictions, and among government, private, nonprofit, and academic organizations.

## PURPOSE 
The purpose of NC-BPAID is to advance a state of comprehensive, interoperable, and routable data on bike, pedestrian, and physical accessibility infrastructure that informs decision-making for individual travelers—as well as the government, private, nonprofit, and academic sectors—through the mechanism of open data standards.

## SCOPE
The scope of the NC-BPAID is limited to: 
- Developing or endorsing open standards and practices that support the objective collection, exchange, portability, and refutability of high-quality data. 
- Facilitating adoption of these standards and practices by data producers and consumers. 
- Promoting the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of bicycle, pedestrian, and physical accessibility infrastructure datasets.

NC-BPAID—as an entity—will not collect or publish data. 

Ultimately, the NC-BPAID should designate an independent and sustainable bicycle, pedestrian, and physical accessibility infrastructure data governance organization that will lead the work of maintaining and adapting the standards over time to reflect evolving real world conditions and soliciting representative involvement from the broad spectrum of stakeholders.

## OBJECTIVES 
The NC-BPAID  shall:

* Objective 1
* Objective 2
* Objective 3

## ACTIVITIES 

The NC-BPAID activities support the objectives presented above by:

* Activity 1
* Activity 2
* Activity 3

## MEMBERSHIP 
Membership in the NC-BPAID is open to national, tribal, subnational, academic, non-profit and for-profit agencies, organizations, and institutions. Members are expected to be active in the creation, collection, processing, publication, integration, visualization, analysis, and curation of bike, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure data within their organization or community.

### Voting Members
The NC-BPAID is committed to collaborative decision-making. In order to reduce power asymetry between members in this process, each organization must have only one vote, and therefore only one voting member. Each member organization shall designate their voting member and inform the NC-BPAID administrative team via email. Only voting members may vote, become a co-chair, or chair a subgroup.

Voting members and their affiliations are listed in this repository: [to be created]().

### Non-Voting Members
Any member of NC-BPAID who is not a voting member is a non-voting member. Non-voting members shall not vote, but they may provide input or influence the discussion and direction of NC-BPAID in other ways.

### Co-Chairs
The NC-BPAID is led by three co-chairs elected from the membership. There shall not be more than one co-chair from a single organization. The co-chair term is one year. If a co-chair exits their term early, a new co-chair will be elected for the remainder of the vacated term. The responsibilities of a co-chair are expected to fill approximately five hours per month. The responsibilities of a co-chair are:
* Strategic leadership of NC-BPAID
* Guide the formation of NC-BPAID's objectives and activities
* Co-host meetings with the administrative team
* Advise subgroups

Ideally, co-chairs are leaders with direct or delegated decision-making authority who are familiar with their organization’s bike, pedestrian, or accessibility infrastructure data assets, needs, and challenges. They should have a deep level of technical acumen, commensurate with the level of specific data sets used by their organization. They will ideally be in a position to drive adoption (e.g., establishing data feeds or standards) within their organization.

## DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURES
Voting happens online, via a GitHub Discussion. The voting period is one week, started by a co-chair or a member of the administrative team.

### Vote Type
| Vote Type  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| +1  | "Yes," "Agree," or "the action should be performed." |
| -1  | “No,” “Disagree,” or “the action should not be performed.”  On issues where consensus is required, this vote counts as a veto. All vetoes must contain an explanation of why the veto is appropriate. Vetoes with no explanation are void. It may also be appropriate for a -1 vote to include an alternative course of action. |
| Abstain  | People can abstain from voting. They can either remain silent or express their reason. Abstentions do not count towards the total votes. |

### Approval Types
Matching the the appropriate approval type to the decision being made shall continue to be clarified as the NC-BPAID makes progress.
| Vote Type  | Description | Hypothetical Example
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Consensus  | 75% majority and no vetoes | Change to specification |
| Majority  | Simple majority | Co-chair election  |
| "Lazy" Approval  | Implicit allowance unless a veto is received, at which time, depending on the type of action, either majority or consensus approval must be obtained.​ | Change to documentation  |

## ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES
1. Co-chairs shall announce meetings, according to a schedule determined by the collaboration. Meetings may be virtual or in-person.  
2. Co-chairs shall coordinate agenda items and make an agenda available at least two days in advance of a meeting.  
3. Co-chairs shall be granted editing rights to the GitHub repository when elected.
5. Co-chairs may implement grammatical changes to any document the collaboration authors.
6. Co-chairs may establish a subgroup via majority vote to accomplish the objectives and activities. By default, subgroups adopt this collaboration framework for their decision-making procedure.
7. Co-chairs shall oversee subgroup activities and subgroup plans are subject to co-chair approval. ​
8. Members shall review and update this collaboration framework as needed, at least annually. The framework shall be adopted by majority vote.
9. Members shall refer unresolvable conflicts to the FGDC Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee Chair for resolution. Members may appeal the chair’s resolution to the FGDC Office of the Secretariat. 

## COORDINATION
The NC-BPAID may employ the tools and mediums best suited to meet its responsibilities such as online webinars, teleconferences, national user forums, annual research initiatives, and cooperative venues, pursuant to the availability of resources. The co-chairs shall coordinate activities with other working groups and subcommittees, FGDC coordination groups, and other appropriate parties that are relevant to accomplishing key activities.

## CONDUCT - PRINCIPLED ENGAGEMENT
Participants in the collaboration shall interact with each other according to the concept of principled engagement. The concept of principled engagement guides individuals, organizations, and communities in their relationships, ensuring that they adhere to ethical standards, respect diversity, and contribute positively to the overall well-being of society. By adhering to these principles, individuals and organizations can contribute to a more ethical, inclusive, and sustainable world. Principled engagement is not a one-size-fits-all concept; rather, it provides a framework for navigating the complexities of human interaction with integrity and purpose. Below are some key aspects of principled engagement:

**Ethical Conduct:** Principled engagement involves behaving ethically in all interactions. This includes honesty, integrity, and transparency. Individuals and organizations commit to making decisions and taking actions that align with moral and ethical principles.

**Respect for Diversity and Inclusion:** A principled engagement approach recognizes and respects the diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences. It promotes inclusive practices that value and incorporate the contributions of individuals from different cultures, genders, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

**Collaboration and Cooperation:** Rather than adopting a competitive or confrontational stance, principled engagement encourages collaboration and cooperation. It recognizes that meaningful progress often comes from working together towards shared goals, even when there are differing opinions.

**Social Responsibility:** Principled engagement extends beyond immediate interactions to consider broader social implications. It involves a sense of responsibility to contribute positively to society, whether through environmentally sustainable practices, philanthropy, or other means of making a constructive impact.

**Long-Term Perspective:** Principled engagement often involves taking a long-term perspective on relationships and outcomes. Instead of seeking short-term gains at the expense of long-term consequences, individuals and organizations prioritize sustainable and enduring solutions.

**Adaptability and Learning:** Embracing principled engagement requires a willingness to adapt and learn. It involves recognizing that principles may need to be refined or adjusted over time as circumstances change, new information emerges, or societal norms evolve.

**Communication:** Effective and respectful communication is a cornerstone of principled engagement. Clear and open communication helps build trust and understanding among individuals and groups, fostering more constructive relationships.

**Conflict Resolution:** In situations where conflicts arise, principled engagement encourages the use of constructive and fair conflict resolution mechanisms. This could involve dialogue, mediation, or other approaches that seek mutually agreeable solutions.

**Personal and Organizational Development:** Individuals and organizations committed to principled engagement often prioritize ongoing personal and organizational development. This involves continuous learning, reflection, and improvement to better align with their principles.
  
## REPORTS 
The NC-BPAID shall develop an annual summary of accomplishments and planned activities, presenting this summary to the GTS Chair for acceptance. The GTS Chair may request the NC-BPAID to prepare special reports, white papers, technical papers, briefings and the like to address pertinent issues, cross-cutting activities, and/or urgent matters consistent with larger FGDC community needs. These requests may come from the FGDC Office of the Secretariat, FGDC Coordination Group, or FGDC member agencies. The NC-BPAID, through its co-chairs, will submit content for the FGDC Annual Report each year, as requested by the FGDC Secretariat. The BPAID will maintain information about its activities on the GitHub web site at [https://github.com/dotbts/BPA](https://github.com/dotbts/BPA).  A reference to the GitHub site shall be established on [fgdc.gov](fgdc.gov).
