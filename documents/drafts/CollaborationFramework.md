# Bike, Pedestrian, and Active Transportation Data Collaboration Framework

## PURPOSE 
The Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee’s (GTS) National Collaboration on Bike, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data (NC-BPAID or BPAID) improves the utility and value of bike, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure data through the application of [FAIR Data Principles](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/information-systems-group/configurable-data-curation-system-cdcs/cdcs-help-and-resources-1) (detailed below).  The application of FAIR Principles improves the data’s Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability.  

This national collaboration is not an advisory body. This collaboration fosters collective action for the benefit all participants and citizens. It accomplishes work which could not be achieved separately by its individual participants. This collaboration is necessary because of the complexities surrounding the creation, collection, processing, publication, integration, visualization, analysis, and curation of bike, pedestrian, and accessibility data from all scales of government, across all jurisdictions, and among government, private, and nonprofit organizations. 

## SCOPE 
The NC-BPAID is accountable to its membership. The FGDC Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee provides leadership, direction, and administrative support in the use and development of geospatial information across national, tribal, subnational, academia, nonprofit, and private sector organizations.  

The scope of the BPAID is limited to… 

## OBJECTIVES 
The NC-BPAID  shall  

## ACTIVITIES 

NC-BPAID activities support the objectives presented above by  

## MEMBERSHIP 
The National Collaboration of Bike, Pedestrian, and Accessibility Infrastructure Data is open to national, tribal, subnational, academic, non-profit and for-profit agencies, organizations, and institutions. Each member organization shall designate a primary point of contact and inform the NC-BPAID administrative team (currently FGDC Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee). 

## VOTING MEMBERS 
BPAID membership is open to the community. Members are expected to be active in the creation, collection, processing, publication, integration, visualization, analysis, and curation of bike, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure data within their community. Voting members must be in a position where they are publishing or consuming bike, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure data.  

Only one vote per each voting organization will be accepted on each of the requests put forth for the BPAID to review, and in the election of co-chairs of the BPAID or its subgroups. In addition to attending two BPAID meetings a year, voting members may volunteer for membership in related subgroups and attend monthly touch-base meetings to monitor progress and provide updates on subgroup activities.  

The ideal participant from each organization is a senior leader with direct or delegated decision-making authority who is intimately familiar with their organization’s bike, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure data assets, needs, and challenges. They should have a deep level of technical acumen, commensurate with the level of specific data sets used by their organization. They will ideally be in a position to drive adoption (e.g., establishing data feeds or standards) within their organization. 

## NON-VOTING MEMBERS 
BPAID membership is open to all. However, organizations deemed ineligible to vote are categorized as observers or friends and will receive a general invitation to the BPAID. These organizations will not be selected as BPAID co-chairs and will not have voting rights. However, their feedback and inputs are documented as part of BPAID summary reports. 

## CO-CHAIRS 
The NC-BPAID is led by two co-chairs elected from national, tribal, subnational, academic, non-profit, or for-profit agencies, organizations, or institutions active in the development and application of policies related to the creation, collection, processing, publication, integration, visualization, analysis, and curation of bike, pedestrian, and accessibility infrastructure data.

## SUBGROUPS 
The BPAID co-chairs may establish subgroups to accomplish the goals, objectives, and activities defined by the collaboration. 

## COLLABORATIVE DECISION MAKING 
1. For significant activities, such as the adoption of changes to a specification, the collaboration shall reach decisions via consensus.
2. The collaboration shall reach consensus by achieving agreement among 75% of voting members or by meeting unanimity minus three votes.
3. The collaboration will use the hardest method when reaching consensus.
4. Abstentions or stand-asides shall not count towards the consensus.
5. The collaboration shall capture and document all dissenting votes.
6. The collaboration allots one vote for each member organization. 

## PROCEDURES
1. BPAID meetings shall be held through an announcement of the co-chairs and conducted according to a schedule determined by the collaboration.
2. Meetings may be held virtually or in-person.
3. Agenda items will be coordinated with other members and will be available at least several days in advance of proposed meeting dates.
4. This document shall be reviewed and updated, as needed, on a regular basis.
5. Co-chairs may approve and implement non-normative changes (e.g., grammatical updates) to any document the collaboration authors.
6. Editing rights to the BPAID GitHub site will be granted to appropriate co-chairs at the beginning of each update cycle.
7. The BPAID co-chairs are responsible for overseeing subgroup activities and retain the right to veto changes to the subgroup Guides.
8. The BPAID may establish additional rules and procedures for conducting business.
9. Unresolved issues will be referred promptly to the Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee Chair for resolution.
10. The GTS’s decision may be appealed to the FGDC Office of the Secretariat. 

## COORDINATION RESPONSIBILITIES 
The BPAID will employ the tools and mediums best suited to meet its responsibilities such as online webinars, teleconferences, national user forums, annual research initiatives, and cooperative venues, pursuant to the availability of resources. The co-chairs will coordinate working group activities with other working groups and subcommittees, FGDC coordination groups, and other appropriate parties that are relevant to accomplishing key activities and effectively growing the geospatial community.

## CONDUCT - PRINCIPLED ENGAGEMENT
Participants in the collaboration will interact with each other according to the concept of principled engagement. The concept of principled engagement guides individuals, organizations, and communities in their relationships, ensuring that they adhere to ethical standards, respect diversity, and contribute positively to the overall well-being of society. By adhering to these principles, individuals and organizations can contribute to a more ethical, inclusive, and sustainable world. Principled engagement is not a one-size-fits-all concept; rather, it provides a framework for navigating the complexities of human interaction with integrity and purpose. Below are some key aspects of principled engagement:

**Ethical Conduct:** Principled engagement involves behaving ethically in all interactions. This includes honesty, integrity, and transparency. Individuals and organizations commit to making decisions and taking actions that align with moral and ethical principles.

**Respect for Diversity and Inclusion:** A principled engagement approach recognizes and respects the diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences. It promotes inclusive practices that value and incorporate the contributions of individuals from different cultures, genders, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

**Collaboration and Cooperation:** Rather than adopting a competitive or confrontational stance, principled engagement encourages collaboration and cooperation. It recognizes that meaningful progress often comes from working together towards shared goals, even when there are differing opinions.

**Social Responsibility:** Principled engagement extends beyond immediate interactions to consider broader social implications. It involves a sense of responsibility to contribute positively to society, whether through environmentally sustainable practices, philanthropy, or other means of making a constructive impact.

**Long-Term Perspective:** Principled engagement often involves taking a long-term perspective on relationships and outcomes. Instead of seeking short-term gains at the expense of long-term consequences, individuals and organizations prioritize sustainable and enduring solutions.

**Adaptability and Learning:** Embracing principled engagement requires a willingness to adapt and learn. It involves recognizing that principles may need to be refined or adjusted over time as circumstances change, new information emerges, or societal norms evolve.

**Communication:** Effective and respectful communication is a cornerstone of principled engagement. Clear and open communication helps build trust and understanding among individuals and groups, fostering more constructive relationships.

**Conflict Resolution:** In situations where conflicts arise, principled engagement encourages the use of constructive and fair conflict resolution mechanisms. This could involve dialogue, mediation, or other approaches that seek mutually agreeable solutions.

**Personal and Organizational Development:** Individuals and organizations committed to principled engagement often prioritize ongoing personal and organizational development. This involves continuous learning, reflection, and improvement to better align with their principles.
