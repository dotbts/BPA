Name,Type,Description
node_id,ID,"A unique identifier for the node. [NOTE: We will fill in instructions here on how to generate IDs, and we will also provide a data validator that may be capable of validating and helping to fill in these IDs.] "
node_type,Enum,"Indicates the type of node.

Valid Options:
virtual
curb_ramp
ramp
elevator
transit_stop
issue
traffic_calming"
presence,Enum,"Indicates whether the piece of infrastructure exists or is present. When other attributes are provided, the existence of the infrastructure can be assumed. This attribute is useful for identifying where a curb ramp or other infrastructure might be missing or where its presence is unknown. Conditionally required if no other identifying attributes provided.

Valid Options:
yes
no
missing
unknown"
date_built,Date,"When the facility was officially opened for use. If the facility has had a major remodeling where the structure, shape or another fundamental aspect was changed, the date of remodeling can be placed here. In ISO 8601 format containing the month and year or just year if month is not available."
check_date,Date,The date that this infrastructure was last inspected. Report the month and year or just year if month is not available.
curb_type,Enum,"The type of curb that is present, if there is not a curb ramp.  

Valid Options:
raised
rolled
flush
generic
driveway
other"
ada_compliance,Enum,"States whether the piece of infrastructure was considered to be ADA compliant the last time it was officially assessed. This attribute should come from formal assessments and not be created using other available data (ex. Width, cross slope, etc.), since compliance status is based on many detailed, interacting factors. If ada_compliance is filled out, ada_compliance_date and ada_compliance_standard should also be filled out.

Valid Options:
yes
no
unknown"
ada_compliance_date,Date,"Indicates the date when ADA compliance was assessed. Report in ISO 8601 format containing month and year, or just year if month is not available. This field is conditionally required if ""ada_compliance"" is filled out."
ada_compliance_standard,Enum,"The specific ADA guidelines or standards used in the assessment of this infrastructure.  This field is conditionally required if ""ada_compliance_standard"" is filled out.

Valid Options:
2010
PROWAG
other"
incline,Float,"Indicates the incline or running slope of the ramp, following the possible directions of travel. Reported as a decimal number describing the percentage of the slope, with two points of precision.

Example:
0.0325"
cross_slope,Float,"Indicates the cross slope of the ramp, which runs perpendicular to the incline / directions of travel. Reported as a decimal number describing the percentage of the slope, with two points of precision. Cannot be negative.

Example:
0.0325"
width,Float,"Indicates the minimum width of the ramp, measured between the handrails if handrails are provided. Reported as a whole number rounded to the nearest inch."
ramp_type,Text,"Indicates the orientation of the ramp in relation to the pedestrian direction of travel at the location. Where a double curb ramp exists, map each ramp as a separate curb_ramp node.

Recommended Options:
diagonal
parallel
perpendicular
unknown"
detectable_warning,Enum,"Describes whether tactile paving is present, and whether or not it has a constrasting color (which should meet ADA guidelines for the amount of contrast). 

Valid Options:
tactile and contrasted
tactile and not contrasted
not tactile and contrasted
no"
impediment,Array<Enum>,"Identifies the type of object that may pose a challenge for travelers passing through the area. Mark an issue with a node only if it is close enough to the footpath or pedestrian way to potentially pose a challenge. “Horizontal overgrowth” refers to temporary obstruction at ground level, such as bushes or plants. “Vertical overgrowth” refers to temporary obstruction between 25-80"" high, such as a branch or limb. “Fixed vertical obstruction” refers to a permanent obstruction between 25-80"" high, such as a sign. “Solid fixed object” includes street furniture, planters and other objects that cannot be difficult to navigate around and are within the pedestrian way. “Flexible fixed object” refers to bollards and other objects that some travelers may be able to navigate around and that are within the pedestrian way. “Protrusion” refers to objects of any type that are primarily located out of the pedestrian way but have some portion of them that sticks out into the pedestrian space.

Valid Options:
yes, no, horizontal overgrowth, vertical overgrowth, fixed vertical obstruction, solid fixed object, flexible fixed object, protrusion, turning space missing or issue, detectable warning not aligned with crossing, push button not working, other"
surface_issue,Array<Enum>,"Identifies the type of damage or surface quality issue that may pose a challenge for travelers.  

Valid Options:
Cracking, scaling, spalling, uneven / displacement, frequent water pooling, heaving, missing bricks / stones, grates / utility covers / other surface impediments, potholes / holes, slickness, uneven joints, markings worn / missing, detectable warning surface damage, other"
rail_crossing,Array<Enum>,"Describes the pedestrian traffic warnings and controls in the approach to the rail crossing. The nodes mark the location of the controls on each side of the tracks. Mark the crossing itself as a virtual link (edge).

Valid Options:
Gates and flashing lights, flashing lights only, crossbucks or stop sign only, tactile markings, other"
stop_id,Integer,The numeric stop_id from GTFS for this transit stop. These IDs can be crosswalked with GTFS and TIDES data to obtain additional stop attributes. May choose between using stop_id and stop_code to identify stops; see the GTFS documentation for more information. agency_id is conditionally required if stop_id is filled out.
agency_id,Integer,"The numeric agency_id from GTFS for the agency that manages this transit stop. Because stop_ids and stop_codes are not unique across agencies within GTFS and TIDES, agency_id must be used in order to uniquely identify stops. Conditionally required if stop_id or stop_code is filled out."
traffic_calming_type,Enum,"Used to identify traffic calming features on a road or crossing. Used when it makes more sense to model the traffic calming feature as a node instead of an edge. Recommended values are from https://www.ite.org/pub/?id=2a60c136-b1c0-b231-0522-ccbd075cac84  and https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:traffic_calming

Valid Options:
chicane, choker, closer, diagonal diverter, lateral shift, median barrier/forced turn island, median island, mini roundabout, raised intersection, realigned intersection, road diet, roundabout"
