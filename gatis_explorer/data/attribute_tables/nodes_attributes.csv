curb_ramp_system_id,Text,"An identifier to link any nodes and/or edges that are involved in the same ""curb ramp system"", which we define as the network of elements that sidewalk users use to transition from a sidewalk to a crossing or other pedestrian edge. For clarity, use the same curb_ramp_system_id for all elements of the same ramp system. The ID can be any unique number to the system.  

Curb ramp systems may include sidewalk edges, curb_ramp_toplanding, curb_ramp_runslope, and crosswalk edges; as well as sidewalk_to_ramp_transition, ramp_to_street_transition or generic nodes.
