Name,Type,Description
node_id,ID,"A unique identifier for the node. [NOTE: We will fill in instructions here on how to generate IDs, and we will also provide a data validator that may be capable of validating and helping to fill in these IDs.] "
node_type,Enum,"Indicates the type of node.

Valid options:
virtual
curb_ramp

Conditionally required if no other identifying attributes provided.

Valid options:
yes
no
missing
unknown"
date_built,Date,"When the facility was officially opened for use.

Example:
2025-03
2014"

Valid options:
raised
rolled
flush
generic
driveway
other"
ada_compliance,Enum,"States whether the piece of infrastructure was considered to be ADA compliant the last time it was officially assessed. This attribute should come from formal assessments and not be created using other available data (ex. Width, cross slope, etc.), since compliance status is based on many detailed, interacting factors. If ada_compliance is filled out, ada_compliance_date and ada_compliance_standard should also be filled out.

Valid options:
yes
no
unknown"
ada_compliance_date,Date,"Indicates the date when ADA compliance was assessed. Report in RFC 3339 format containing day, month and year, or just month and year or year if day or month is not available. This field is conditionally required if ""ada_compliance"" is filled out.

Example:
2025-03
2014"
ada_compliance_standard,Enum,"The specific ADA guidelines or standards used in the assessment of this infrastructure.  This field is conditionally required if ""ada_compliance_standard"" is filled out.

Valid options:
2010
PROWAG
other"
incline,Float,"Indicates the incline or running slope of the ramp, following the possible directions of travel. Reported as a decimal number describing the percentage of the slope, with two points of precision.

Example:
0.0325"
cross_slope,Float,"Indicates the cross slope of the ramp, which runs perpendicular to the incline / directions of travel. Reported as a decimal number describing the percentage of the slope, with two points of precision. Cannot be negative.

Example:
0.0325"
width,Float,"Indicates the minimum width of the ramp, measured between the handrails if handrails are provided. Reported as a whole number rounded to the nearest inch."
ramp_type,Text,"Indicates the orientation of the ramp in relation to the pedestrian direction of travel at the location. Where a double curb ramp exists, map each ramp as a separate curb_ramp node.

Recommended options:
diagonal
parallel
perpendicular
unknown"
detectable_warning,Enum,"Describes whether tactile paving is present, and whether or not it has a constrasting color (which should meet ADA guidelines for the amount of contrast). 

Valid options:
tactile and contrasted
tactile and not contrasted
not tactile and contrasted
no"
impediment,Array&lt;Enum>,"Identifies the type of object that may pose a challenge for travelers passing through the area. Mark an issue with a node only if it is close enough to the footpath or pedestrian way to potentially pose a challenge. “Horizontal overgrowth” refers to temporary obstruction at ground level, such as bushes or plants. “Vertical overgrowth” refers to temporary obstruction between 25-80"" high, such as a branch or limb. “Fixed vertical obstruction” refers to a permanent obstruction between 25-80"" high, such as a sign. “Solid fixed object” includes street furniture, planters and other objects that cannot be difficult to navigate around and are within the pedestrian way. “Flexible fixed object” refers to bollards and other objects that some travelers may be able to navigate around and that are within the pedestrian way. “Protrusion” refers to objects of any type that are primarily located out of the pedestrian way but have some portion of them that sticks out into the pedestrian space.

Valid options:
yes
no
horizontal overgrowth
vertical overgrowth
fixed vertical obstruction
solid fixed object
flexible fixed object
protrusion
turning space missing or issue
detectable warning not aligned with crossing
push button not working
other"
surface_issue,Array&lt;Enum>,"Identifies the type of damage or surface quality issue that may pose a challenge for travelers.  

Valid options:
Cracking
scaling
spalling
uneven / displacement
frequent water pooling
heaving
missing bricks / stones
grates / utility covers / other surface impediments
potholes / holes
slickness
uneven joints
markings worn / missing
detectable warning surface damage
other"
rail_crossing,Array&lt;Enum>,"Describes the pedestrian traffic warnings and controls in the approach to the rail crossing. The nodes mark the location of the controls on each side of the tracks. Mark the crossing itself as a virtual link (edge).

Valid options:
Gates and flashing lights
flashing lights only
crossbucks or stop sign only
tactile markings
other"
gtfs_id,Array&lt;Object>,"An array of objects containing keys for GTFS agency_id and stop_id from an existing GTFS dataset for this transit stop. Represent as string with the format ""{agency_id},{stop_id}"". These IDs can be crosswalked with GTFS and TIDES data to obtain additional stop attributes and connect to the broader transit network. See GTFS documentation for more information.

Example:
[{""agency_id"": ""1234"", ""stop_id"":""5678""}]"
traffic_calming_type,Enum,"Used to identify traffic calming features on a road or crossing. Used when it makes more sense to model the traffic calming feature as a node instead of an edge. Recommended values are from https://www.ite.org/pub/?id=2a60c136-b1c0-b231-0522-ccbd075cac84  and https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:traffic_calming
