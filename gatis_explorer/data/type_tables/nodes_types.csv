Name,Description,Tier
generic,"Used to create nodes for routing in places where specific physical infrastructure doesn’t exist, but where edges are split because attributes are different, or where other nodes don’t suit the purpose. Used for connecting edges within bike infrastructure for routing purposes. 
",Tier 3
curb_ramp,"In Tiers 1-2, a node that indicates the location of curb ramps. In Tier 1, this node may be placed anywhere in the curb ramp space. In Tier 2, this node should be placed as close to the point of transition between the curb (safe pedestrian space) and street as possible, with footway edges and generic nodes used where needed to fully connect the node to sidewalk, crossing and other connected edges. In Tiers 3-4, the curb_ramp node is replaced with the sidewalk_to_ramp_transition and ramp_to_street_transition nodes (as well as the associated edge), and with more granular mapping of the curb ramp space.",Tier 1
sidewalk_to_ramp_transition,"A node that, in pedestrian infrastructure, connects a curb ramp edge (type=curb_ramp_runslope) to a turning area (or top landing; type=curb_ramp_toplanding) edge. 

This node often represents the threshold over which a user transitions from sidewalk or turning spaces which are of no/low-slope to a sloped surface that, at its other end, is flush with the street level/crossing. 

This node should be placed spatially in the center of the interface between the ramp and the turning area (perpendicular to the direction of travel) such that user applications can model the ramp's width attribute in two equal parts on each side of this node. See the GATIS Playbook https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NJIyzpRFZYbStU7Esa5gB3ZS8yMq78rL/edit?slide=id.p4#slide=id.p4 for examples and guidance on where/how to use.",Tier 3
ramp_to_street_transition,"A node that, in pedestrian infrastructure, connects a crossing to a ramp edge (type=curb_ramp_runslope). This node type often represents the threshold over which a user transitions from a ramp (i.e. pedestiran space) to vehicle/street-space or vice-versa depending on their direction of travel across the crossing/edges associated with this node. 

Because of this possible transition from pedestrian to vehicle space and the safety implications therein, it's critical this node be placed as accurately as possible (spatially) and as often as possible in the dataset where applicable to provide users the best information on when and where this critical transition occurs. 

This node should be placed spatially in the center of the interface between the ramp and the street surface such that user applications can model the ramp's width attribute in two equal parts on each side of this node. See https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NJIyzpRFZYbStU7Esa5gB3ZS8yMq78rL/edit?slide=id.p4#slide=id.p4 for examples and guidance on where/how to use.",Tier 3
