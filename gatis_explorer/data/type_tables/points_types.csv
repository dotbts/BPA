Name,Description,Tier
object,"A physical object that is likely to be of interest to travelers. Depending on the traveler, an object may be an amenity or an obstruction. Objects are represented as points and are not connected to the graph network. A buffer may be drawn around objects relevant to routing to create a node in the network at their location.",Tier 3
sign,A sign that conveys information about travel or infrastructure to bicyclists or pedestrians. The point shows the precise location of the sign.,Tier 4
transit_stop,A point indicating the location of a transit stop of any kind.,Tier 3
issue,"A point indicating a particular spot that has an issue relevant to routing for some travelers. Issue points primarily mark points along edges that may be of concern, although they may be used in other locations. Note that the curb_ramp node type in Tiers 1 and 2 has the same impediment, surface_issue and other_issue attributes that can be used on issue points, so indicating these issues on the node itself is preferable. In Tiers 3 and 4, indicate curb ramp issues on the curb_ramp_runslope and curb_ramp_toplanding edges.",Tier 4
counter,"A point indicating the location of a camera, sensor, pneumatic tube, inductive loop, magnetometer or other mechanism for counting the number of bicyclists or pedestrians passing through a counting site. Only add a point of type ""counter"" to GATIS data when there is data available for that site through a count-specific dataset or specification. GATIS does not contain fields for properly describing counts data. If the data from the count-specific dataset or specification is in any format other than point, such as polygon or line, place the GATIS point in the middle of the polygon or line in the other specification. The counter_site_id field is the primary means of mapping the data between its source and GATIS.",Tier 3
bike_parking,"A point indicating the location of a bicycle or micromobility parking facility. This point type is provided primarily for integration with data from the General Bicycle Feed Specification or other third party specifications, though it may also be used to add data from any other dataset to GATIS.",Tier 4
traffic_calming,"Used to identify where traffic calming features are located. If possible, use the traffic_calming zone type to show the area affected by the feature. The traffic_calming point is available for when mapping of the area is not available.",Tier 3
pushbutton,"Identifies the location of a signal button, accessible pedestrian signal, or pedestrian or cyclist detector. The pushbutton point identifies the location of infrastructure that a traveler either can or must interact with to trigger a signal -- not the signal head. Within GATIS, signal heads are not mapped. See the Relations Table for more information on associating a pushbutton point with the crossing edge or edges it affects.",Tier 3
detector,"Identifies the location of a pedestrian or cyclist detector. The detector point identifies the location of the sensor -- not the signal head. Within GATIS, signal heads are not mapped. See the Relations Table for more information on associating a detector point with the crossing edge or edges it affects.",Tier 3
