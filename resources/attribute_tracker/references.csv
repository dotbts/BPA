The Oâ€˜ahu Bike Plan was prepared with broad public input via workshops, website questionnaires and draft reviews. It is a comprehensive plan addressing the five â€œEâ€™sâ€ of transportation planning (i.e., encouragement, engineering, education, enforcement and evaluation), considered vital to achieve the end state of a truly bicycle-friendly island.

Maryland Bicycle Routes,Bicycle Routes (Road-Separated),bike,"This version contains Road-Separated Bike Routes AND the connectors to the road network.“Road Separated” indicates that these segments are physically separated from roads in which motorized vehicles travel. That is, these are not bike lanes, sharrows, or signed bike routes per se – these segments are separated from the main road by a physical barrier (E.g., grass, natural earth, trees, etc.) and in many instances do not follow a motorized vehicle route network at all (E.g., a wholly separated trail). This information in this web map will be used in conjunction with the One Maryland One Centerline (OMOC) initiative to provide a Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) map for the State of Maryland. The recommended LTS score for each road-separated bicycle route is listed in the pop-up menu.Bikeways included in the map are of varying surface material but are typically paved or hard-packed surface.  Sidewalks, typically 6-feet-wide, hard surface pathways primarily for pedestrian use, are not included in this map. The preferred width of bikeways included is at least 10-feet wide, although bikeways may be narrower if anticipated traffic volumes are minimal. For instance, while most pathways within Columbia are 8 to 10 feet wide, some pathways are narrower when connecting to cul-du-sacs.  These narrower pathways are included in the map as the anticipated traffic volume are low enough to minimize user conflict. The feature class used in the web map was compiled by the Maryland Department of Transportation (Secretary’s Office) using a variety of sources including (but not limited to) state data sources from various agencies including the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), Maryland Department of Planning (MDP), and Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Data has also been augmented by counties and municipalities throughout the State of Maryland as well as several agencies, organizations, and conservancies. Certain named trails are included within this dataset and their sources have varied from state, local, and non-profits as well as through the digitizing of various aerial/satellite imagery, digital elevation models (DEM), right-of-ways, former railways, and corridors by MDOT staff. None of the alignments included in this dataset are restricted to private use.The searchable data includes attribute information containing the route’s name (if applicable), calculated segment length (using the Maryland State Plane 1983 Projection), and Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) score. The data mostly contains alignment segments with a LTS of 0, the lowest score. This score indicates that the bikeway can be comfortably used by cyclists of all levels and experience and has minimal automobile traffic interaction. There are several segments with LTS scores of 1 or 2 within this feature class as well, but these are mostly connector paths/trails between larger segments. LTS scores of 1 or 2 indicate very little automobile traffic and/or slower speeds required for the automobile traffic.ATTRIBUTES:Route Name (if Applicable): The name of the route is provided if the route is namedCounties within Route: The counties in Maryland through which the route passes are listedRoute's Length: The route distance is calculated and listed in miles.

For this map (road-separated routes) the scores range from 0 (road-separated) to 2 (generally low traffic).

Utah Trails and Pathways,TrailsAndPathways,both,"Last Update: 09/06/2022This trails map layer represents off-road recreational trail features and important road connections that augment Utahâ€™s recreational trail network. This map layer features many of Utahâ€™s recreational trails but is not yet complete. Currently, the trails information primary depicts trails used by hiking and mountain biker users. It began with map data purchased from a private entity (Orbital View, Inc), for which full rights were purchased by the GOED Office of Outdoor Recreation in July 2014. Since the original purchase, subsequent substantive updates have included: 2014 Revisions from National Park service; 2015 additions from Emery County; June 2016 additions from Cache County US Forest Service Geodata Hub (all forests except Sawtooth in NW Box Elder County), and Mountainland Association of Governments (Utah and Wasatch counties). Significant updates were made in 2018 as part of the multimodal project. These included pathways and off-road bike trails in the project area. Additional trails can be submitted to Utah UGRC for <removed> in this map layer.Note: Presently, the planned approach for on street bicycle lanes and routes is to incorporate them in the the statewide roads GIS layer using left and right side attributes. On street bike infrastructure is not expected to be represented in this map layer.More information about this layer can be found here: https://gis.utah.gov/data/recreation/trails/",UDOT,UT,Utah,Open Data,2025,47562,27,https://uplan.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=4fa51e538c29471594068d95161ff327,https://services1.arcgis.com/99lidPhWCzftIe9K/arcgis/rest/services/TrailsAndPathways/FeatureServer/0,,

The desktop inventory was developed in 2014/2015 using WisDOT Photo Log and Google Earth satellite images. It is recognized that there are gaps and limitations in the data, for example interstate interchange sidewalk locations may not be identified where they intersect local roadways. A desktop inventory data validation effort determined that the initial Desktop Inventory may have been missing about 8% of the existing curb ramp and sidewalk locations.

It is not recommended to use the Sidewalks Desktop Inventory for project design or construction. The Sidewalks Desktop Inventory data is suitable for providing an estimate of the number and locations of sidewalks on the STN.

Multi-use paths are classified as the lowest stress (LTS score of 1). Please refer to the Low-Stress Bicycle Network Report, and updated segment methodology for additional detail. Description of Bicycle Routing OptionsThe routing application provides recommended bicycling route directions between an origin and destination using three different routing settings:Low-Stress Only: use of exclusively low-stress routes (LTS 1 or 2).Moderate-Stress: moderate-stress routes (LTS 1-3), but with low-stress preferred via a time penalty added to moderate stress routes when determining the route.Unrestricted: use of any legal bicycling route (LTS 1-4), but with low- and moderate-stress routes preferred via the most severe time penalty added to high-stress routes and a lesser penalty added to moderate-stress routes.Travel times shown are actual times (based on an average bicyclistâ€™s speed of 10 mph) without the time penalties used by the application to determine the route.Description of LTS Levels for Street SegmentsLTS 1: Paths and streets with 1 lane per direction, speed limits â‰¤ 20 mph, and low traffic volumes, or up to 25 mph with bike lanes.LTS 2: Streets with 1 lane per direction, speed limits â‰¤ 30 mph, and low traffic volumes and/or bike lanes.LTS 3: Streets with 1-2 lanes per direction, speed limits â‰¤ 35 mph, and moderate traffic volumes and/or bike lanes.LTS 4: Streets with 2+ lanes per direction, with high speed limits and/or high traffic volumes.The LTS score for an intersection approach is based on the intersection configuration. Specifically, the score is based on whether there is a right-turn only lane and, if so, whether there is a â€œpocketâ€ bike lane to the left of the right-turn lane and other details related to the design of these lanes and the curb radius of the intersection. Description of LTS levels for Intersection ApproachesNo effect: Simple intersection with no right-turn lane, or a single right turn lane of less than 75 feet with slow turning speeds.LTS 2: Intersection with a single right-turn lane of less than 150 feet and a bike lane that continues straight.LTS 3: Intersection with a right-turn lane of 75-150 feet and no bike lane, a bike lane that shifts to the left across a right-turn lane with slow turning speeds, or a bike lane that continues straight alongside a turn lane of more than 150 feet.LTS 4: Other intersection configurations, including multiple right-turn lanes and/or higher turning speeds.The LTS score for an unsignalized intersection crossing is based on the number of travel lanes per direction on the intersecting street to be crossed, the presence of a median (for multi-lane streets), and the speed limit on the intersecting street. Description of LTS Levels for Intersection CrossingsUnsignalized CrossingsLTS 1: Intersecting street has only 1 lane per travel direction and speed limit â‰¤ 30 mph.LTS 2: Intersecting street has only 1 lane per travel direction and speed limit â‰¤ 35 mph or 2 lanes but speed limit â‰¤ 30 mph.LTS 3: Intersecting street has 1 lane per travel direction and a speed limit of 40+ mph, or 2 lanes and a speed limit of 35 mph.LTS 4: Intersecting street has 2 lanes per travel direction and 40+ mph speed limit, or 3+ lanes.In some cases, intersection crossing LTS is reduced below these levels if the intersecting street is one-way only or is equipped with a median refuge. Signalized CrossingsCrossing streets at signalized intersections does not present a significant barrier for bicyclists and thus does not affect the LTS score unless a right turn lane is present.",City of Madison,WS,"Madison, WS",Open Data,,43971,102,https://usdot.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c203c656c7b3465cb68118918c09f7a4,https://maps.cityofmadison.com/arcgis/rest/services/Public/OPEN_DATA_TRANS/MapServer/56,,

Boise Pathways,Boise Pathways Master Plan,both,"This is a line data set representing existing and proposed pathways that are part of the City of Boise’s planned pathway network. A pathway is defined as any paved path intended for two-way, non-motorized travel such as biking, walking, or other forms of active transportation.  Pathways are off-street facilities and are typically categorized as either shared use paths or sidepaths based on their physical setting. Pathways are a minimum of 10 feet wide (8 feet in constrained corridors where anticipated pathway traffic is low). Boise’s neighborhoods, subdivisions, and parks contain many walking paths that are not considered existing pathways for the purpose of this plan because of their narrow width and inability to accommodate two-way travel. Gaps in the planned pathway network will need to be filled using on-street facilities.  On-street connections will either be sidepaths along arterial roadways or low-stress bikeways on collector/local roads.Developed with the plan’s goals in mind, over 110 pathway projects are proposed in the Boise Pathways Master Plan, making new connections throughout the City, including potential future development areas, and introducing 112 miles of pathway. Combined with Boise’s ~50 miles of existing pathways, the built-out network will string together a total of over 160 miles of pathways. More information can be found at https://www.cityofboise.org/departments/planning-and-development-services/planning-and-zoning/comprehensive-planning/boise-pathways-plan/. The data set was created from analysis completed by consultant Alta Planning & Design for the 2021 Pathways Master Plan. It included a review of existing pathways documented through City of Boise Parks and Recreation. The accuracy is unknown. This data was created by the City of Boise.  This data is updated as needed.
