These first three types are actual curbs, most commonly constructed of concrete: Blockface (3110), Corner (3120) and Island (3130). The dataset also includes Shoulders (3140), which graphically indicate the edge of pavement where there is no structural curb, and Parking Blocks (3150), which are generally short lengths of flexible curb used as an extra safety barrier, such as in bicycle corral configurations.

        "description": "WSDOT evaluated and assigned a Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) ranking to WA state highway segments to aid in efforts to analyze high-level systemic safety and user acceptance of state highways for active transportation users. This data was also intended to inform high-level prioritization of active transportation improvements. LTS data rank highway segments from 1 to 4 based on roadway characteristics like posted speed, vehicle volume, number of travel lanes, and presence of active transportation infrastructure like sidewalks and bike lanes. WSDOT deemed LTS 1 suitable for all ages and abilities. LTS 2 is considered suitable for most active travelers. LTS 3 and 4 represent functional gaps in active transportation networks that present systemic safety issues and likely deter use of active modes.The data reports a Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (PLTS) and Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (BLTS) based on the presence of mode-specific infrastructure and calculated using guidance from the WSDOT Design Manual, updated September 2024. PLTS is calculated using Exhibits 1520-1 and 1520-2 based on the presence of sidewalks recorded in WSDOT enterprise sidewalk data and presence and width of a paved shoulder recorded in the State Highway Log Roadway Data Shoulders dataset. BLTS is calculated using Exhibits 1520-5, 1520-6, and 1520-7 based on the presence and width of bike lanes recorded in the State Highway Log Special Use Lanes dataset. Data is not currently available on presence of separation materials, so bike lanes were only considered based on their width. The General LTS measure is based on Exhibit 1520-5. Ramp segments are included in the dataset with a default LTS ranking of 999. This ranking indicates that all ramps are to be considered high LTS (3 or 4) unless a manual evaluation of the roadway characteristics indicates otherwise. Datasets were not available that would enable ramp rankings to be determined systematically based on posted speed, traffic volume, and number of travel lanes, however a manual review of many ramp configurations across the state indicated that most ramps present LTS concerns.The data provided is not a substitute for detailed investigation of a location when specific investment decisions are being considered. The specific characteristics of locations with the same LTS rankings could vary considerably. It is important to note that an LTS 1 or 2 location might have additional, unmeasured characteristics that reduce its presumed suitability for active travel.For additional information regarding ranking methodology or other questions about WSDOT\u2019s Level of Traffic Stress dataset, contact Grace Young (grace.young@wsdot.wa.gov).",

        "description": "This feature class represents the points that were used for the Route Directness Index calculation. These points were generated along the increasing state routes as represented by the 12/31/2023 WSDOT LRS. Points were only generated within Population Centers (using the Population Centers dataset obtained from the GIS Workbench in January 2025). Every 0.01 mile (52.8 feet) along the route a transect was created perpendicular to the route extending 500 feet on each side of the route. These points represent the midpoint of each transect. The Route Directness Index (RDI) is a ratio that compares the straight-line (crow-flies) distance from one point to another across a barrier to the actual distance imposed by the network of paths available to a traveler. RDI data is particularly relevant to pedestrian and/or bicyclist trips due to the extra time, physical energy, and exposure to weather that out of direction travel creates. A complete discussion of route directness, including potential applications to decision making, can be found Washington State Multimodal Permeability Pilot, August 2021 [https://wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/MultimodalPermeabilityPilotReport-Aug2021.pdf].RDI can be analyzed at different scales. A high-level analysis of RDI can address questions that compare population centers across the state or consider whether the RDI values are generally similar within a given population center or tend to vary in different portions of a population center. High level data could be combined with other statewide data such as crash data, transit stops, level of traffic stress data, destination data, etc. to analyze potential correlations. High level RDI data is less useful for analyzing a particular crossing location or recommending solutions to address high RDI values. A more detailed analysis is likely required when questions involve corridor studies or project evaluations. Detailed location information can refer to key destinations and crossing locations that are not captured using higher level network maps.The lowest RDI is 1 because a trip between those points can be made directly along an existing roadway. The actual methodology analyzed hypothetical trips where the start and end points were about a quarter mile apart relative to a straight line. In such a situation, an RDI of 2 would mean the trip is twice the distance it might otherwise be, or about one-half mile. Although one-half mile is not particularly far, the RDI is independent of the actual distance. We might start further down the road and if the RDI remained a 2 our trip distance would be twice as long as it could have been. The RDI thus measures the real or perceived burden or travel cost incurred by a person walking or bicycling. ",

The Plan builds on DTS\u2019s 1999 Honolulu Bicycle Master Plan (that focused on the K\u0101hala to Pearl City Corridor). The O\u2018ahu Bike Plan was prepared with broad public input via workshops, website questionnaires and draft reviews. It is a comprehensive plan addressing the five \u201cE\u2019s\u201d of transportation planning (i.e., encouragement, engineering, education, enforcement and evaluation), considered vital to achieve the end state of a truly bicycle-friendly island. While actual bicycle facilities (e.g., lanes, routes and paths) are critical to achieving bike friendliness, implementation of strong policies and programs included in the Plan is essential, and in many instances more cost effective and implementable, to making our roads safer and more accessible to bikes.",

        "description": "Last Update: 09/06/2022This trails map layer represents off-road recreational trail features and important road connections that augment Utah\u2019s recreational trail network. This map layer features many of Utah\u2019s recreational trails but is not yet complete. Currently, the trails information primary depicts trails used by hiking and mountain biker users. It began with map data purchased from a private entity (Orbital View, Inc), for which full rights were purchased by the GOED Office of Outdoor Recreation in July 2014. Since the original purchase, subsequent substantive updates have included: 2014 Revisions from National Park service; 2015 additions from Emery County; June 2016 additions from Cache County US Forest Service Geodata Hub (all forests except Sawtooth in NW Box Elder County), and Mountainland Association of Governments (Utah and Wasatch counties). Significant updates were made in 2018 as part of the multimodal project. These included pathways and off-road bike trails in the project area. Additional trails can be submitted to Utah UGRC for <removed> in this map layer.Note: Presently, the planned approach for on street bicycle lanes and routes is to incorporate them in the the statewide roads GIS layer using left and right side attributes. On street bike infrastructure is not expected to be represented in this map layer.More information about this layer can be found here: https://gis.utah.gov/data/recreation/trails/",

        "description": "Centerline file used for Bike LTS Network. Has existing streets and bike paths integrated.Clean topology. All connections are end point to end point.Bridges involving bike paths cleaned manually to accommodate bug in Network Analyst connectivity using elevation fields.The Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) system rates or scores streets and paths by calculating an LTS score (1, 2, 3, or 4) for each street or multi-use path segment, intersection approach, and intersection crossing and then assigning the highest of the three scores to the segment. In those cases where the intersection LTS score is higher than the street segment score, the street segment encompassing the first block on either side of the intersection is given the higher intersection score. LTS scores for street segments are based on the posted speed limit, traffic volumes, number of travel lanes, and bicycle lane or bicycle/parking lane dimensions. Multi-use paths are classified as the lowest stress (LTS score of 1). Please refer to the Low-Stress Bicycle Network Report, and updated segment methodology for additional detail. Description of Bicycle Routing OptionsThe routing application provides recommended bicycling route directions between an origin and destination using three different routing settings:Low-Stress Only: use of exclusively low-stress routes (LTS 1 or 2).Moderate-Stress: moderate-stress routes (LTS 1-3), but with low-stress preferred via a time penalty added to moderate stress routes when determining the route.Unrestricted: use of any legal bicycling route (LTS 1-4), but with low- and moderate-stress routes preferred via the most severe time penalty added to high-stress routes and a lesser penalty added to moderate-stress routes.Travel times shown are actual times (based on an average bicyclist\u2019s speed of 10 mph) without the time penalties used by the application to determine the route.Description of LTS Levels for Street SegmentsLTS 1: Paths and streets with 1 lane per direction, speed limits \u2264 20 mph, and low traffic volumes, or up to 25 mph with bike lanes.LTS 2: Streets with 1 lane per direction, speed limits \u2264 30 mph, and low traffic volumes and/or bike lanes.LTS 3: Streets with 1-2 lanes per direction, speed limits \u2264 35 mph, and moderate traffic volumes and/or bike lanes.LTS 4: Streets with 2+ lanes per direction, with high speed limits and/or high traffic volumes.The LTS score for an intersection approach is based on the intersection configuration. Specifically, the score is based on whether there is a right-turn only lane and, if so, whether there is a \u201cpocket\u201d bike lane to the left of the right-turn lane and other details related to the design of these lanes and the curb radius of the intersection. Description of LTS levels for Intersection ApproachesNo effect: Simple intersection with no right-turn lane, or a single right turn lane of less than 75 feet with slow turning speeds.LTS 2: Intersection with a single right-turn lane of less than 150 feet and a bike lane that continues straight.LTS 3: Intersection with a right-turn lane of 75-150 feet and no bike lane, a bike lane that shifts to the left across a right-turn lane with slow turning speeds, or a bike lane that continues straight alongside a turn lane of more than 150 feet.LTS 4: Other intersection configurations, including multiple right-turn lanes and/or higher turning speeds.The LTS score for an unsignalized intersection crossing is based on the number of travel lanes per direction on the intersecting street to be crossed, the presence of a median (for multi-lane streets), and the speed limit on the intersecting street. Description of LTS Levels for Intersection CrossingsUnsignalized CrossingsLTS 1: Intersecting street has only 1 lane per travel direction and speed limit \u2264 30 mph.LTS 2: Intersecting street has only 1 lane per travel direction and speed limit \u2264 35 mph or 2 lanes but speed limit \u2264 30 mph.LTS 3: Intersecting street has 1 lane per travel direction and a speed limit of 40+ mph, or 2 lanes and a speed limit of 35 mph.LTS 4: Intersecting street has 2 lanes per travel direction and 40+ mph speed limit, or 3+ lanes.In some cases, intersection crossing LTS is reduced below these levels if the intersecting street is one-way only or is equipped with a median refuge. Signalized CrossingsCrossing streets at signalized intersections does not present a significant barrier for bicyclists and thus does not affect the LTS score unless a right turn lane is present.",

        "description": "This is a line data set representing existing and proposed pathways that are part of the City of Boise\u2019s planned pathway network. A pathway is defined as any paved path intended for two-way, non-motorized travel such as biking, walking, or other forms of active transportation.  Pathways are off-street facilities and are typically categorized as either shared use paths or sidepaths based on their physical setting. Pathways are a minimum of 10 feet wide (8 feet in constrained corridors where anticipated pathway traffic is low). Boise\u2019s neighborhoods, subdivisions, and parks contain many walking paths that are not considered existing pathways for the purpose of this plan because of their narrow width and inability to accommodate two-way travel. Gaps in the planned pathway network will need to be filled using on-street facilities.  On-street connections will either be sidepaths along arterial roadways or low-stress bikeways on collector/local roads.Developed with the plan\u2019s goals in mind, over 110 pathway projects are proposed in the Boise Pathways Master Plan, making new connections throughout the City, including potential future development areas, and introducing 112 miles of pathway. Combined with Boise\u2019s ~50 miles of existing pathways, the built-out network will string together a total of over 160 miles of pathways. More information can be found at https://www.cityofboise.org/departments/planning-and-development-services/planning-and-zoning/comprehensive-planning/boise-pathways-plan/. The data set was created from analysis completed by consultant Alta Planning &amp; Design for the 2021 Pathways Master Plan. It included a review of existing pathways documented through City of Boise Parks and Recreation. The accuracy is unknown. This data was created by the City of Boise.  This data is updated as needed. It is current to the date of publication.",

Speed limits are indicated primarily for streets that have speeds greater than 25 MPH, unless the speed limit has been changed from a higher speed or a speed survey has been conducted to enforce the de facto speed limit of 25 MPH. 25 MPH is the de fact speed limit for most residential and commercial streets, and apply to streets on this map denoted by a 0 MPH label. Alleys narrower than 25 feet can have de facto speed limits of 15 MPH. \n\nB. METHODOLOGY  Speed limit legislation information is taken from MTAB legislation and in some cases directives from engineers in the 5212 classification. Speed limit implementation information is taken from SSD Shops Reports and then parsed via python code. Implementation for speed limits will specify when signs are put in stating the new speed limits, and the work order that the sign installation was spec'd in.  \n\nC.

        "description": "A. SUMMARY \nLocations of painted safety zone in San Francisco. A pedestrian safety zone is a painted buffered curb-side space between the sidewalk and moving vehicles. Their footprint resembles a bulb out, helping to emphasize that the space should not be treated as part of the roadway. As a low-cost, easily-implemented treatment, painted safety zones enhance pedestrian safety by (1) Improving line of sight between pedestrians and motorists and (2) Providing motorists with visual cues that encourage careful maneuvering near pedestrians. Painted safety zones do not extend the sidewalk, as pedestrians still wait to start their crossing at the existing curb line. However, their future conversion to concrete bulbouts will provide all the benefits of a wider sidewalk.\n\nB. METHODOLOGY  \nManually updated. Search \"Painted Safety Zone\" and \"PSZ\" through Work Order Database and confirm work completed date. Confirm with striping drawing in Official Records. Cross-reference with WalkFirst Element Tracking System.\n\nC. UPDATE FREQUENCY  \nAs needed \n\nD. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  \nN/A",

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset lists intersections that have at least one continental crosswalk and meet the following criteria:\n<li> Installed after January 1st, 2015\n<li> Installed before January 1st, 2015 and on the high injury network\n\nContinental crosswalks are marked with bold, wide stripes to indicate safe places for pedestrians to cross the road. Their high-visibility design helps alert drivers and cyclists to watch for people crossing.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLocations of continental crosswalks collected at the intersection level. Pre-2015 data was collected in the summer of 2019 as a one-time effort to locate every intersection with continental crosswalks on the city's High Injury Network. Crosswalks painted post-2015 are collected as part of Vision Zero data reporting. \"Shops reports\" are used as the data source. Shops reports include data citywide. Crosswalks marked \"UNDETERMINED\" in the \"CONTINENTAL\" field may or may not have continental crosswalks and require additional scrutiny.
